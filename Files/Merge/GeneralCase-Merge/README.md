Exercise

Two binary files are available: <“employees”> and <“students”>.
Each record of the first file contains the fields:
  
- ID, surname, first name, salary
- ID, surname, first name, average

Both files are sorted alphabetically by surname / first name / ID. Both files must be read only once, and must not be stored in arrays. 
The salary is double and the average is float.

Write a program that by reading both files, updates the salary of those employees who have a student record with an average higher than 7, by 7.28%.
